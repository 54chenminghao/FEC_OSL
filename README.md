# FEC_OSL
Encrypted traffic classification is crucial for enhancing network management, service quality, and security. In realworld scenarios, emerging traffic flows often include unknown classes, posing significant challenges in identifying unknown flows while simultaneously classifying known ones. Existing deep learning methods typically rely on the closed-world assumption, which limits their performance in handling unknown traffic in openworld scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end fine-grained encrypted traffic classification method based on open-set semi-supervised learning, called FEC-OSL. This method comprises three mutually reinforcing core components. First, we design a dual-branch flow feature extraction module to capture detailed and discriminative flow features. Second, we introduce a novel energy-based perspective that leverages energy boundary learning to distinguish known flows from unknown flows, enabling precise detection of known classes. Finally, an adaptive deep clustering approach integrates feature learning with clustering to achieve fine-grained classification of unknown flows. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, and the results validated that our proposed method exhibits outstanding performance in handling both known and unknown encrypted traffic in open-world scenarios.
